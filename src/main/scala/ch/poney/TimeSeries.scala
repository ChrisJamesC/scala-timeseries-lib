   *  
   *  The passed TSEntry sequences will be merged according to the merge operator,
   *  which will always be applied to one of the following:
   *    - two defined TSEntries with exactly the same domain of definition
   *    - a defined entry from A and None from B
   *    - a defined entry from B and None from A
   *    - No defined entry from A nor B.
   *    
   *  Overlapping TSEntries in the sequences a and b are trimmed to fit
   *  one of the aforementioned cases before being passed to the merge function.
   *  
   *  For example, 
   *    - if 'x' and '-' respectively represent the undefined and defined parts of a TSEntry 
   *    - '|' delimits the moment on the time axis where a change in definition occurs either 
   *       in the present entry or in the one with which it is currently being merged
   *    - 'result' is the sequence resulting from the merge
   *    
   *    We apply the merge function in the following way:
   *  
   *  a_i:    xxx|---|---|xxx|xxx
   *  b_j:    xxx|xxx|---|---|xxx
   *  
   *  result: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
   *  
   *  (1),(5) : op(None, None)
   *  (2) : op(Some(a_i.value), None)
   *  (3) : op(Some(a_i.value), Some(b_j.value))
   *  (4) : op(None, Some(b_j.value))
   *  
   *  Assumes a and b to be ORDERED!
